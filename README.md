# Bonacci

A probabilistic programming approach to the sequence-description problem.

Currently, bonacci can learn conditionals, repetitions, ranges, basic expressions, and concatenations of each.

Next steps are to add understanding of recursion, and support for nested statements (e.g. nested ifs)
